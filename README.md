![Screenshot](extras/feature-demo-parameters.jpg)

## Description

This field plug-in is meant to demonstrate how to access and use parameters when developing your own field plug-ins. A list of the current parameters will be shown below the text input field. If one of the parameters is "color", this plug-in will change the color of the field label to that value.

*Note: this is not intended to be used to collect actual data. It is intended for demonstration/testing purposes.*
